<li><strong>How many cases vs controls does HPAP currently  have including Type-2 diabetes?</strong></li></p>
<p><br />
  <strong>Ans.</strong> As of <em>September 2021</em>, there are more than <em>102 donors</em> in our database (including both T1D and T2D cases and controls). The <em>Time series chart</em> on the<a href="https://hpap.pmacs.upenn.edu/explore/data-status"> <em>Data status page</em></a> as well as the <a href="https://hpap.pmacs.upenn.edu/"><em>home page</em></a> (under <em>&quot;</em>our donors&quot; section) will give you up-to-date count of donors, in different categories i.e. <em>T1D</em>, <em>T2D</em> and <em>No Diabetes</em>. </p>
<p>Donors currently visible on PANC-DB- </p>
<ol type="a">
<li><strong>T1D donors</strong>- 24 count</li>
<li><strong>T2D donors</strong>- 22 count</li>
<li><strong>No Diabetes</strong> or <strong>No HX diabetes</strong>- 56 count</li>
</ol>
<p></p>
<li><strong>How long does it take a donor to be added to PANC-DB once procured? Are there any baseline requirements to make a new donor available to donors?</strong></li><br/>

<strong>Ans:</strong>Accepting donor organs into the HPAP program and entering them into our database is a dynamic and ongoing process. Hence, often the total donor count on PANC-DB does not represent total donors accepted or being processed at a given time. For a snap-shot of our procurement process, go <a href="https://hpap.pmacs.upenn.edu/explore/procurement"><em>here</em></a>. <em>Typically, new donors are posted on PANC-DB <strong>within 14 days </strong>after the organs have been procured.</em></p>
<p>Once a donor organ is procured by HPAP, it is processed for tissue and isle cell retrieval. The curation team receives some key information from this time to generate a locally unique ID for these samples, which is used to make a blank dataset and made available o the teams to input their assay data (which happens in an ad hoc manner and for many assays happens in batches every few monhs). The time it takes for a new donor to show up on PANC-DB post procurement depends on whether or not we have either some key clinical and demographic information on the donor or ther complete clinical summary. The importan information needed (i.e. a new donor cannot be made visible without these attributes) are HPAP-ID, Age, gender, race, BMI, HbA1c%
<p></p>
  <li><strong>Do you have Type-2 diabetes donors as well?</strong></li><br/>

<strong>Ans:</strong> Yes. Just select  the <em>T2D </em>option in the <em>Disease </em>filter on the left side of the <a href="https://hpap.pmacs.upenn.edu/explore/donor/"><em>Donor </em></a><a href="https://hpap.pmacs.upenn.edu/explore/donor/"><em>Information</em></a> page on PANC-DB.
<p></p>
<li><strong>Are the controls age matched?</strong></li><br />

<strong>Ans:</strong> Not necessarily, but one can age-match or match according to other demographics using our filter. Although, HPAP makes every  attempt to obtain age-matched controls as they become available; however, the  number of organ donors in the US is small
<p></p>
<li><strong>What is the difference or similarity between the "No Diabetes" cases or "controls" for the T1D and T2D programs?</strong></li><br/>
<strong>Ans:</strong> The controls differs between the two groups only in age distribution. T1D cases tend to be younger than T2D cases. However, we always planned that some of the controls could be used for comparisions with either T2D or T1D.  When selecting controls, investigators have to ensure that the disease and control groups do not differ significantly in age, BMI, and sex.

<p></p>
  <li><strong>What are the donor snapshots?</strong></li><br />

<strong>Ans:</strong> The donor-cards or snapshots give an brief summary of the most  salient features of each donor, such a biographical information, disease and  autoantibody status, and islet composition.
<p></p>
<li><strong>Can we compare data between different donors?</strong></li>
<br />
  
<strong>Ans:</strong> Yes. Data  from various donors can be selected and compared depending on the user&rsquo;s biological  question.

<h2 align="center"><a name="_Toc45125820" id="_Toc45125820">Pre-and Post-processing information for all data</a></h2><br/>

<p></p>
<ol type="1">
    <li><strong>Where can I get information regarding sample pre  and post processing?</strong></li><br />

<strong>Ans:</strong> &nbsp;Information on equipment used and  different processes are covered in the <em>Data  Workflow</em> section <a href="https://hpap.pmacs.upenn.edu/explore/procurement">here</a> &nbsp;which 
also has the SOPs for different  experiments.

<p></p>
    <li><strong>Were the bulk and single cell RNA sequencing performed  on total pancreatic islet cells or were any populations sorted for sequencing?</strong></li><br />
  
<strong>Ans:</strong> Bulk  RNA seq were done using sorted alpha and sorted beta cells.&nbsp; scRNA seq  used dissociated (not sorted) unsorted islet  preparations, which by necessity have different degrees of purity.
<p></p>
<li><strong>Does the scRNA seq data on pancreatic islets  include infiltrating immune cells, or only endocrine cells?</strong></li><br />
  
<strong>Ans:</strong> Since  scRNA-seq were done using islets that have been dissociated (see response above),  &nbsp;non-endocrine cells (i.e. immune cells and stromal cells), &nbsp;that are embedded within  islets are  captured and analyzed as well.
<p></p>
<li><strong>How were the pancreatic islets  processed and/or  sorted for the scRNA seq analysis?</strong></li><br />

<strong>Ans:</strong> There  is no sorting for scRNA-seq.&nbsp; Islets preparations  of varying purity were dissociated into single cells  &nbsp;and then &nbsp;processed for the library.
<p></p>
<li><strong>Is there a list of all the panels and/or markers  that have been used for analysis of the samples, specifically for T cell  studies?</strong></li><br />

<strong>Ans:</strong> Yes, please check it out <a href="https://hpap.pmacs.upenn.edu/explore/workflow/immunobiology?protocol=4">here</a> in the <em>Data workflow</em> section for Immunobiology.

<p></p>
<li><strong>What pre-processing have the IMC images on  PANC-DB have undergone?</strong></li><br />
 
<strong>Ans:</strong> The single-channel images on the website available for download in the <a href="https://hpap.pmacs.upenn.edu/explore/download?donor"><em>Download data</em></a> section, are original unaltered images.  The  preselected  overlays in the IMC viewer  (in the <a href="https://hpap.pmacs.upenn.edu/explore/donor/"><em>Donor Information</em></a> page) underwent hot-pixel removal, but not  compensation, prior to overlaying of the channels. Note that all IMC data can also be viewed on  PancreAtlas via a link from PANC-DB, where the users can select and manipulate  individual channels as they see  fit.
<p></p>
<li><strong>How is &ldquo;baseline secretion&rdquo; and &ldquo;fold  stimulation&rdquo; calculated?</strong></li><br />
<strong>Ans: </strong> Currently, fold stimulation is calculated as follows:<br/>
<ul type="disc">
<li>Baseline secretion-  baseline average of values from first 10 time points (mostly 20-30 mins)</li>
<li>Fold stimulation- Local-max values / Lead-in Avg values</li>
<li>Local max- MAX value in the 80-100 mins range (80-100 min time points)</li>
<li>Lead-in Avg- AVG of values between 60-80 min range (60-80 min time points)</li>
<br/>
</ul>
However, we are in the process of updating the formula that generates these values. Please contact us <a href="https://hpap.pmacs.upenn.edu/contact"> here</a> and we can get you in touch with the investigators directly if necessary.
