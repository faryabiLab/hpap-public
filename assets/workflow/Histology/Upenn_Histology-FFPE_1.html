        <li>
          The most commonly used is NBF&#44; which is purchased in a
          ready&#45;to&#45;use form and is thus very convenient. Arguably&#44;
          4&#37; paraformaldehyde is&#44; in many cases&#44; a superior fix for
          immuno&#45;histochemistry as it tends to yield reduced background
          staining but must be freshly made just before use
        </li>
        <li>
          Many researchers believe that tissue may be stored indefinitely in
          10&#37; NBF without harm. This is partly true&#59; sections cut from
          such material and stained with a routine histological stain
          &#40;e.g.&#44; Hematoxylin and Eosin&#45; &#39;H&#38;E&#39;&#41; will
          look fine
        </li>
        <li>
          Problems&#44; however&#44; will likely arise when such material is
          used for immuno&#45;staining since the cross&#45;linking action
          continues and may irreversibly change the conformation &#40;i.e.&#44;
          reduce the antigenicity&#41; of antibody targets
        </li>
        <li>
          If you intend to use your tissue for immuno&#45;staining be careful
          not to &#39;over&#45;fix&#39; the tissue
        </li>
        <li>
          Fixation method &#47; time &#47; temperature is a variable that needs
          to be considered when developing immuno&#45;histochemistry protocols.
          Significantly altering fixation times between batches of specimens can
          have major consequences on the quality of immuno&#45;stains
        </li>
        <br />
      </ol>

      <li><strong>Some general suggested fixation guidelines</strong></li>
      <br />
      <ol type="1">
        <li>
          For routine fixation in 10% NBF, dissect the tissue as rapidly as
          possible and immerse in a large volume of fix (i.e., at least 20X
          volume of fix to tissue). Place at 4 degrees and fix
          &lsquo;overnight&rsquo;. After fixation, wash the tissue well in
          several changes of Phosphate Buffered Saline (PBS).
        </li>
        <li>
          Tissue may be stored in cold PBS for short periods of time (2 or 3
          days) but should be placed in 70% ethanol for extended storage. The
          tissue will be safe in the EtOH since there is no danger of bacterial
          degradation. However note that it has been reported that
          <strong>proteins can be extracted </strong>by extended storage in
          ethanol and that storage in PBS with sodium azide added at 4 degrees
          is a better choice. Safest of all is to promptly fix, wash and deliver
          your samples for processing and embedding.
        </li>
        <li>
          Tissue may be brought to our lab for processing in either PBS or 70%
          EtOH.
        </li>
        <li>
          The size of the specimen being fixed should be considered. A commonly
          quoted rate of penetration for aldehyde fixes is two-to-three
          millimeter per hour. This rate is, of course, variable depending on
          the density and other characteristics of different tissues and is
          simply a rule of thumb, but it follows that trying to fix very large
          pieces of tissue runs the risk of under-fixing the interior of the
          specimen resulting in biologic degradation of the constituent
          molecules.
        </li>
        <li>
          For solid material (e.g., liver) the longest dimension should not
          exceed 10-15mm.
        </li>
        <li>
          For very small pieces of tissue (~1-2mm range dimensions) an overnight
          fix may in fact be too long. One to several hours may be a better
          choice for this material but be aware that changing times of fixation
          between experiments may have serious effects on subsequent
          immuno-stains.
        </li>
        <li>
          Please try to be consistent to reduce variable staining results.
        </li>
        <br />
      </ol>

      <li><strong>Some specific considerations </strong></li>
      <br />

      <ol type="1">
        <li>
          Different tissues degrade at different rates post excision. When
          collecting multiple tissue types it is wise to fix the enzyme&#45;rich
          ones first. For example&#44; pancreas degrades extremely rapidly and
          should always be taken first followed by liver and so forth
        </li>

          />
        </p>
        <br />
        <li>
          Tissue hardens upon fixation and remains in whatever shape it was
          fixed in. This should be considered in those cases where the final
          orientation of the sections is important. Pancreas&#44; for
          example&#44; is very pliable when dissected and if simply dropped into
          fix will likely harden into some rough spheroid shape. If your
          intention is to look at sections with a &#34;maximum footprint&#34;
          &#40;a term of art meaning maximum viewable area&#41; the pancreas has
          to be spread out flat in a cassette lined with a biopsy sponge before
          fixation occurs
        </li>
        <li>
          The quality of sections cut on a microtome suffer badly from several
          &#40;avoidable&#41; causes. During the post fixation processing step
          all water is extracted from the cellular spaces of the tissue and is
          replaced with paraffin
        </li>
        <li>
          This is carried out using a vacuum-based automatic machine in which
          the tissue is dehydrated via a series of graded ethanols followed by
          xylenes and finally liquid paraffin
        </li>
        <li>
          The processed tissue is then oriented in a mold&#44; embedded in a
          paraffin block and is ready to section
        </li>
        <li>
          The density and general consistency of the tissue is more or less that
          of the paraffin and cutting good sections is fairly straightforward.
          The inclusion of materials with radically different hardness in the
          block&#44; however&#44; wreaks havoc&#33; When such material comes in
          contact with the microtome blade it causes severe ripping and tearing
          of the entire section
        </li>
        <li>
          Things to avoid include&#58; <strong>fecal material</strong> in
          intestine&#44; especially in the colon where this material is very
          hard&#59; <strong>hair</strong> is particularly bad&#45;if you are
          bringing us skin to be sectioned be sure to remove the hair before
          fixation. This can be done using a razor blade or clippers. We can
          loan you our clippers if you need them. Hair can also sometimes be
          inadvertently included
        </li>
        <li>
          Please be careful during dissections&#59;
          <strong>sutures</strong>&#45;if you have done a ligation prior to
          dissection please be sure to not include the thread or staples with
          the specimen
        </li>
        <br />

          Labeling tissue cassettes. The cassettes into which the tissue is
          placed are subsequently exposed to ethanols and xylenes in the
          processor
        </li>
        <li>
          If you label your cassettes with a regular magic marker the writing
          will come off in the xylene. It is devastating to lose the identity of
          your specimens&#33; We try to test the labeling for xylene
          insolubility before processing but why take the chance that we may
          forget to do this? Unless you have the special pens we use&#44;
          <strong>label your cassettes with pencil&#33;</strong>
