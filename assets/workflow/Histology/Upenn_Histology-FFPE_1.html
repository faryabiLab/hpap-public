<ol type="I">
  <li><strong>Standard Chemical Tissue Fixation </strong></li>
<br/>
<ol type="1">
  <li>Aldehyde fixatives (formalin, 10% Neutral Buffered Formalin (NBF),  4% Paraformaldehyde (PFA), gluteraldehyde) &ldquo;fix&rdquo; tissue (i.e., arrest  biological degradation) by forming chemical &ldquo;cross-links&rdquo; between and within  proteins. </li>
  <li>The most commonly used is NBF, which is purchased in a  ready-to-use form and is thus very convenient. Arguably, 4% paraformaldehyde  is, in many cases, a superior fix for immunohistochemistry as it tends to yield  reduced background staining but must be freshly made just before use. </li>
  <li>Many researchers believe that tissue may be stored indefinitely in  10% NBF without harm. This is partly true; sections cut from such material and  stained with a routine histological stain (e.g., Hematoxylin and  Eosin-&lsquo;H&amp;E&rsquo;) will look fine. </li>
  <li>Problems, however, will likely arise when such material is used  for immunostaining since the cross-linking action continues and may  irreversibly change the conformation (i.e., reduce the antigenicity) of  antibody targets. </li>
  <li>If you intend to use your tissue for immuno-staining be careful  not to &lsquo;over-fix&rsquo; the tissue. </li>
  <li>Fixation method / time / temperature is a variable that needs to be  considered when developing immunohistochemistry protocols. Significantly  altering fixation times between batches of specimens can have major consequences  on the quality of immunostains. </li><br/>
</ol>

  <li><strong>Some general  suggested fixation guidelines</strong></li>
  <br/>
<ol type="1">
  <li>For routine fixation in 10% NBF, dissect the tissue as rapidly as  possible and immerse in a large volume of fix (i.e., at least 20X volume of fix  to tissue). Place at 4 degrees and fix &lsquo;overnight&rsquo;. After fixation, wash the  tissue well in several changes of Phosphate Buffered Saline (PBS). </li>
  <li>Tissue may be stored in cold PBS for short periods of time (2 or 3  days) but should be placed in 70% ethanol for extended storage. The tissue will  be safe in the EtOH since there is no danger of bacterial degradation. However  note that it has been reported that <strong>proteins can be extracted </strong>by  extended storage in ethanol and that storage in PBS with sodium azide added at  4 degrees is a better choice. Safest of all is to promptly fix, wash and  deliver your samples for processing and embedding. </li>
  <li>Tissue may be brought to our lab for processing in either PBS or  70% EtOH. </li>
  <li>The size of the specimen being fixed should be considered. A  commonly quoted rate of penetration for aldehyde fixes is two-to-three  millimeter per hour. This rate is, of course, variable depending on the density  and other characteristics of different tissues and is simply a rule of thumb,  but it follows that trying to fix very large pieces of tissue runs the risk of  under-fixing the interior of the specimen resulting in biologic degradation of  the constituent molecules. </li>
  <li>For solid material (e.g., liver) the longest dimension should not  exceed 10-15mm. </li>
  <li>For very small pieces of tissue (~1-2mm range dimensions) an  overnight fix may in fact be too long. One to several hours may be a better  choice for this material but be aware that changing times of fixation between  experiments may have serious effects on subsequent immunostains. </li>
  <li>Please try to be consistent to reduce variable staining results. </li><br/>
</ol>

<li>&nbsp;<strong>Some specific  considerations </strong></li><br/>

<ol type="1">
  <li>Different tissues degrade at different rates post excision. When  collecting multiple tissue types it is wise to fix the enzyme-rich ones first.  For example, pancreas degrades extremely rapidly and should always be taken  first followed by liver and so forth. <strong></strong></li><br/>
  <p><img src="/assets/workflow/Histology/image-1.JPG" alt="Histology FFPE SOP" width="600" height="650" style= "vertical-align:middle"/></p><br/>
    <li>Tissue  hardens upon fixation and remains in whatever shape it was fixed in. This  should be considered in those cases where the final orientation of the sections  is important. Pancreas, for example, is very pliable when dissected and if  simply dropped into fix will likely harden into some rough spheroid shape. If  your intention is to look at sections with a &ldquo;maximum footprint&rdquo; (a term of art  meaning maximum viewable area) the pancreas has to be spread out flat in a  cassette lined with a biopsy sponge before fixation occurs. </li>
    <li>The quality of sections cut on a microtome suffer badly from  several (avoidable) causes. During the post fixation processing step all water  is extracted from the cellular spaces of the tissue and is replaced with  paraffin.</li>
    <li>This is carried out using a vacuum-based automatic machine in  which the tissue is dehydrated via a series of graded ethanols followed by  xylenes and finally liquid paraffin.</li>
    <li>The processed tissue is then oriented in a mold, embedded in a  paraffin block and is ready to section.</li>
    <li>The density and general consistency of the tissue is more or less  that of the paraffin and cutting good sections is fairly straightforward. The  inclusion of materials with radically different hardness in the block, however,  wreaks havoc! When such material comes in contact with the microtome blade it  causes severe ripping and tearing of the entire section.</li>
    <li>Things to avoid include: <strong>fecal material</strong> in intestine, especially  in the colon where this material is very hard; <strong>hair</strong> is particularly bad&mdash;if you  are bringing us skin to be sectioned be sure to remove the hair before  fixation. This can be done using a razor blade or clippers. We can loan you our  clippers if you need them. Hair can also sometimes be inadvertently included.</li>
    <li>Please  be careful during dissections; <strong>sutures</strong>-if you have done a ligation prior to  dissection please be sure to not include the thread or staples with the  specimen.</li><br/>

    <li>Labeling tissue cassettes. The cassettes into which the tissue is  placed are subsequently exposed to ethanols and xylenes in the processor.</li>
    <li>If you label your cassettes with a regular magic marker the  writing will come off in the xylene. It is devastating to lose the identity of  your specimens! We try to test the labeling for xylene insolubility before  processing but why take the chance that we may forget to do this? Unless you  have the special pens we use, <strong>label your cassettes with pencil!</strong></li><br/>
