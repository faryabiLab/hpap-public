        sucrose and then keep at 4 &#8451;. Alternatively&#44; 30&#37; sucrose
        can be prepared in a larger quantity, filtered through a 0.22 mm and

      <li>
        Collect 2&#45;3&#45;mm thick cross&#45;sectional slices from the
        Head&#44; Body&#44; and Tail &#40;see the pancreas mapping&#41;
      </li>
      <li>
        Cut each slice into four quadrants &#40;A&#44; B&#44; C&#44; D&#41; in
        a clockwise manner
      </li>
      <ul>
        <b><em>Note&#58; for donors &lt; 1 year of age keep the entire slice
            intact</em></b>
      </ul>
      <li>
        Transfer the tissue into a 50-mL Falcon tube containing 40 mL of
        freshly prepared fixative (4.0 % paraformaldehyde/100 mM PBS) and fix
        for 3 hours on ice under mild agitation using an adjustable tilt
        rocker (LabNet).
      </li>
      <li>
        Wash the tissue four times in 40 mL of 100 mM PBS on ice over the
        period of 2-3 hours under mild agitation using an adjustable tilt
        rocker. Blot the tube with paper towel before adding the fresh washing
        solution.
      </li>
      <li>
        Equilibrate the tissue in 40 mL of 30% sucrose/10 mM PBS at 4&deg;C
        overnight. Tissue will settle to bottom of the tube.
      </li>
      <ul>
        <b><em>Note&#58; if the pancreas is not cleaned sufficiently from
            fat&#44; it will never drop to bottom</em></b>
      </ul>

      <li>
        Prepare a cryo&#45;mold &#40;VWR&#44; 25608&#45;916&#41; and fill it
        half way with an OCT compound &#40;VWR&#44; 25608&#45;930&#41;&#46;
        Pour contents of the tube with the pancreas into a 10&#45;cm Petri
        dish. Pick the pancreas with a pair of fine forceps and blot it with
        Kimwips to remove an excess of sucrose. Place the tissue into the
        OCT&#45;containing cryo&#45;mold. Using forceps&#44; push the tissue
        lightly to bottom of the cryo&#45;mold. Add more OCT to fill
        completely the cryo&#45;mold. Freeze the tissue on a dry ice block or
        by placing in a &#8722;80 &#8451; freezer
