          Antibody heavy chain &#40;IGH&#41; gene rearrangements were bulk
          sequenced from genomic DNA&#46;
        </li>
        <li>
          Genomic DNA was isolated from sorted or bulk cell populations using
          the QIAGEN Gentra Puregene Kit &#40;Qiagen&#44; Cat&#46; No&#46;
          158388&#41;&#46; For further details on the sorted cell populations,

        <li>
          Antibody heavy-chain variable region rearrangements were amplified
          using framework 1 region &#40;FR1&#41; &#43; JH primers that were
          adapted from EuroClonality primers for next&#45;generation
          sequencing&#44; as described in Meng <em>et al</em>&#59; 2017&#46;
        </li>
        <li>
          Typically 100 ng of input DNA was amplified per replicate&#46;
          Sequencing libraries were prepared using 2 &times; 300 bp
          paired&#45;end kits &#40;Illumina MiSeq Reagent Kit v3&#44;
          600&#45;cycle, Illumina Inc&#46;&#44; San Diego&#44; CA&#41;&#46; For
