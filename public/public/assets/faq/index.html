<p></p>
<li style="font-weight: bold;">How many cases vs controls does HPAP currently  have including Type-2 diabetes?</li><br />
As of September  2020, more than 65  cases total. The <em>Time series chart</em> in the home page of the website under <em>Our Donors</em> section will give you up-to-date count of donors, in different categories. currently it shows a count of over 300 due to samples from another study being hosted on PANC-DB. We are working on separating the samples to reflect only HPAP donor count in this chart.
<p></p>
  <li style="font-weight: bold;">Do you have Type-2 diabetes donors as well? </li><br/>

 Yes. Just select  the <em>T2D </em>option in the <em>Disease </em>filter on the left side of the <a href="https://hpap.pmacs.upenn.edu/explore/donor/"><em>Donor</em></a><a href="https://hpap.pmacs.upenn.edu/explore/donor/"><em>Information</em></a> page on PANC-DB.
<p></p>
<li style="font-weight: bold;">Are the controls age matched?</li><br />

 Not necessarily, but one can age-match or match according to other demographics using our filter. Although, HPAP makes every  attempt to obtain age-matched controls as they become available; however, the  number of organ donors in the US is small
<p></p>
  <li style="font-weight: bold;">What are the donor snapshots? </li><br />

 The donor-cards or snapshots give an brief summary of the most  salient features of each donor, such a biographical information, disease and  autoantibody status, and islet composition.
<p></p>
<li style="font-weight: bold;">Can we compare data between different donors? </li>
<br />
  
 Yes. Data  from various donors can be selected and compared depending on the user&rsquo;s biological  question.

<h2><li><a name="_Toc45125820" id="_Toc45125820">Pre-and Post-processing information for all data</a></li></h2>

<p></p>
<ol type="1">
    <li style="font-weight: bold;">Where can I get information regarding sample pre  and post processing? </li><br />

&nbsp;Information on equipment used and  different processes are covered in the <em>Data  Workflow</em> section <a href="https://hpap.pmacs.upenn.edu/explore/procurement">here</a> &nbsp;which 
also has the SOPs for different  experiments.

<p></p>
    <li style="font-weight: bold;">Were the bulk and single cell RNA sequencing performed  on total pancreatic islet cells or were any populations sorted for sequencing?</li><br />
  
Bulk  RNA seq were done using sorted alpha and sorted beta cells.&nbsp; scRNA seq  used dissociated (not sorted) unsorted islet  preparations, which by necessity have different degrees of purity.
<p></p>
<li style="font-weight: bold;">Does the scRNA seq data on pancreatic islets  include infiltrating immune cells, or only endocrine cells?</li><br />
  
Since  scRNA-seq were done using islets that have been dissociated (see response above),  &nbsp;non-endocrine cells (i.e. immune cells and stromal cells), &nbsp;that are embedded within  islets are  captured and analyzed as well.
<p></p>
<li style="font-weight: bold;">How were the pancreatic islets  processed and/or  sorted for the scRNA seq analysis?</li><br />

There  is no sorting for scRNA-seq.&nbsp; Islets preparations  of varying purity were dissociated into single cells  &nbsp;and then &nbsp;processed for the library.
<p></p>
<li style="font-weight: bold;">Is there a list of all the panels and/or markers  that have been used for analysis of the samples, specifically for T cell  studies?</li><br />

Yes, please check it out <a href="https://hpap.pmacs.upenn.edu/explore/workflow/immunobiology?protocol=4">here</a> in the <em>Data workflow</em> section for Immunobiology.

<p></p>
<li style="font-weight: bold;">What pre-processing have the IMC images on  PANC-DB have undergone?</li><br />
 
The single-channel images on the website available for download in the <a href="https://hpap.pmacs.upenn.edu/explore/download?donor"><em>Download data</em></a> section, are original unaltered images.  The  preselected  overlays in the IMC viewer  (in the <a href="https://hpap.pmacs.upenn.edu/explore/donor/"><em>Donor Information</em></a> page) underwent hot-pixel removal, but not  compensation, prior to overlaying of the channels. Note that all IMC data can also be viewed on  PancreAtlas via a link from PANC-DB, where the users can select and manipulate  individual channels as they see  fit.
<p></p>
<li style="font-weight: bold;">How is &ldquo;baseline secretion&rdquo; and &ldquo;fold  stimulation&rdquo; calculated?</li><br />
Currently, fold stimulation is calculated as follows:<br/>
<ul type="disc">
<li>Baseline secretion-  baseline average of values from first 10 time points (mostly 20-30 mins)</li>
<li>Fold stimulation- Local-max values / Lead-in Avg values</li>
<li>Local max- MAX value in the 80-100 mins range (80-100 min time points)</li>
<li>Lead-in Avg- AVG of values between 60-80 min range (60-80 min time points)</li>
<br/>
</ul>
However, we are in the process of updating the formula that generates these values. Please contact us <a href="https://hpap.pmacs.upenn.edu/contact"> here</a> and we can get you in touch with the investigators directly if necessary.
