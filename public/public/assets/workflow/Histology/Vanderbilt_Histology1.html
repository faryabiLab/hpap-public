  </br>
<ol type="1">
  
    <li>1X <strong>PBS/10 mM PBS, 1L: </strong>1.44 g Na2HPO4        (dibasic), 0.2 g KH2PO4 (monobasic), 8.0 g NaCl,        2.0 g KCl; pH 7.5. <em>Prepare from scratch        or use 1X PBS without Ca/Mg, Invitrogen, 14190-144.</em></li>

    <li><strong>100 mM PBS, 1L:</strong> 12.07 g Na2HPO4  (dibasic), 2.04 g KH2PO4 (monobasic), 8.0 g NaCl, 2.0 g  KCl; pH 7.5. Prepare fresh and keep at 4&deg;C. Based on Electron  Microscopy Sciences catalog, 100 mM PBS filtered through a 0.22 mm  filter has a shelf life of 1 month at 4&deg;C. </li>
    <li><strong>16% Paraformaldehyde (PFA): </strong>Electron Microscopy  Sciences, 15710. Right before fixation, prepare 4% paraformaldehyde solution.  Open the vial containing 10 mL of 16% paraformaldehyde stock, transfer contents  of vial into a 50-mL Falcon tube, add 30 mL of 100 mM PBS, mix and place the  tube on ice.</li>
    <ul style="alignment-adjust:auto"> 
    <b><em>Note:&nbsp;Prepare as many tubes as many tissue slices will be procured  considering approximately 1:50 tissue to fixative ratio.</em></b>
    </ul>
    <li><strong>Sucrose:</strong> Fisher Scientific, BP220-1. Prepare 30%  sucrose solution: 15 g sucrose + 35 mL 10 mM PBS in <a name="OLE_LINK1" id="OLE_LINK1">a 50-mL  Falcon tube</a>. Place the tube on a rocker to dissolve sucrose and then keep  at 4&deg;C. Alternatively, 30% sucrose can be prepared  in a larger quantity, filtered through a 0.22 mm and stored at 4&deg;C  for 1 month.</li>
    
    <ul style="alignment-adjust:auto">
    <b><em>Note:&nbsp;consider approximately 1:50 tissue to  sucrose ratio.</em></b>
    </ul>
    </ol>

 <font size="+1"> <li><strong>Procedure</strong></li></font>
  </br>
  <ol type="1">
    <li>Collect  2-3-mm thick cross-sectional slices from the Head, Body, and Tail (see the  pancreas mapping).</li>
    <li>Cut each slice into  four quadrants (A, B, C, D) in a clockwise manner.</li>
    <ul style="alignment-adjust:auto">
    <b><em>Note:&nbsp; For donors &lt; 1 year of age keep the entire slice  intact.</em></b>
    </ul>
    <li>Transfer  the tissue into a 50-mL Falcon tube containing 40 mL of freshly prepared  fixative (4.0 % paraformaldehyde/100 mM PBS) and fix for 3 hours on ice under  mild agitation using an adjustable tilt rocker (LabNet).</li>
    <li>Wash  the tissue four times in 40 mL of 100 mM PBS on ice over the period of 2-3  hours under mild agitation using an adjustable tilt rocker. Blot the tube with  paper towel before adding the fresh washing solution.</li>
    <li>Equilibrate  the tissue in 40 mL of 30% sucrose/10 mM PBS at 4&deg;C overnight. Tissue  will settle to bottom of the tube.</li> 
     <ul style="alignment-adjust:auto">
    <b><em>Note:&nbsp; If the pancreas is not cleaned sufficiently from fat, it will never drop to  bottom.</em></b>
    </ul>
    
    <li>Prepare  a cryomold (VWR, 25608-916) and fill it half way with an OCT compound (VWR,  25608-930). Pour contents of the tube with the pancreas into a 10-cm Petri  dish. Pick the pancreas with a pair of fine forceps and blot it with Kimwips to  remove an excess of sucrose. Place the tissue into the OCT-containing cryomold.  Using forceps, push the tissue lightly to bottom of the cryomold. Add more OCT  to fill completely the cryomold. Freeze the tissue on a dry ice block or by  placing in a -80&deg;C freezer.</li>
