<br />
<ol type="1">
<li>On the day receiving the shipped human pancreatic islets, hand-picked islets are  dissociated to single cells using StemPro accutase (Gibco/Fisher, A11105-01). Plate  cells in 35-mm cell culture dishes, and culture in DMEM with 5.5 mM glucose, 10%  FBS, and 100 U/mL penicillin/ streptomycin for 1-4 days. </li>
<li>Start patch clamping single cells after one overnight incubation, and continue  patching cells for up to 4 days. Electrical activities are measured by using a pipette  coated with sylgard (3 ~ 5 M&#937;) in  a heated chamber (32&ndash;35&deg;C). Quality control is assessed by the stability of  seal (&gt;10 G&#937;)  and access resistance (&lt;15 M&#937;).</li>
<li>Perform electrical activity  measurements in 1 minute from &ldquo;break in&rdquo; of cell membrane; measurement  protocols include (in order): exocytosis, voltage-gated Na and Ca channel  currents activated at -10 mV, and -120 mV, voltage-gated Na and Ca channel  currents activated from -60 to +30 mV, steady-state inactivation of  voltage-gated Na channel currents, reversal potential, hyperpolarization-activated  non-selective cation currents activated at -140 mV.</li>
<li>When finishing all the measurements, use another big-tip pipette (0.2 ~ 0.5  M&#937;) prefilled with 0.5 ml  lysis mix, suck the cell into the pipette, and transfer it into a 0.2ml PCR tube  prefilled with 4 ml lysis mix. </li>
<li>Save cells in -80 &deg;C freezer before shipping out for sequencing.</li>
