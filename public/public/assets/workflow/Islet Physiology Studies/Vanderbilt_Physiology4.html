<h2><strong>Quantitative Assessment of Islet  Viability by Staining with Trypan Blue Dye</strong></h2>

  <ol start="1" type="1">
    <li><u>Islet Equivalent        (IEQ)</u>:        An islet with a diameter of 150 &micro;m determined mathematically by        compensating for islet shape. </li>
    <li><u>Trypan Blue stain</u>:&nbsp; A vital stain used to selectively color        dead tissues or cells blue. Trypan Blue is a diazo dye. In a viable cell        Trypan Blue is excluded, however, it traverses the membrane in a dead        cell (similar to propidium iodide). Hence, dead cells have a distinctive        blue color under a microscope.</li>

<ul>
  <ul>
    <ul>
      <li>Prepare 2 aliquots of approximately 150 IEQs of handpicked islets in  1.5 mL tubes to determine viability of islets. Note: This is important  especially for islet preparations with lower purity where cell death in the  contaminating exocrine compartment may occur at higher rate compared to islets  and thus could lead to underestimating islet viability. </li>
      <li>Wash islets with 2mM EDTA made in 1X PBS and centrifuge them at  1000 rpm for 1 minute at 4&deg;C. Repeat two times.</li>
      <li>After last wash, resuspend the pellet in 500 mL of Accutase.</li>
      <li>Triturate  islets for 10 minutes at 37&deg;C using a multichannel pipet with 200 mL tips. Note: As islets are  getting dispersed, the sample should become slightly opaque. </li>
      <li>Quench the reaction with 500 mL of  CMRL-1066 media containing 10% FBS, 2 mM L-glutamine, 1%  penicillin/streptomycin. </li>
      <li>Rinse the cells with 1 ml of CMRL-1066 medium, centrifuge at 1800  rpm for 3 minutes at 4&deg;C. Carefully remove the media without disturbing the  pellet at the bottom of the tube. Repeat one more time. </li>
      <li>Resuspend the cell pellet in 100 mL of  CMRL-1066 medium by gently flicking the tube and keep the sample on ice.</li>

    <li>Cell Counting</li>
  </ol>
</ol>
<ul>
  <ul>
    <ul>
      <li>From each islet sample, transfer two 15 mL aliquots of the cell suspension  into 1.5 ml tubes. Mix well before pipetting the sample.</li>
      <li>Prepare the cell counting chamber slide for sample  loading (slide has two chambers and looks similar to the hemocytometer but  without grids).</li>
      <li>Gently mix the first aliquot of the islet cell  suspension with 15 mL of Trypan Blue dye and  then load 10 mL of the mixture into the  chamber slide. </li>
      <li>Wait approximately 20 seconds for the cells to  spread out on a slide, insert the slide into the Countess II cell counter and  acquire cell counts following instrument guidelines. The output of cell and  viability counts for a cell suspension of purified islets is illustrated in <strong>Figure 1</strong>.</li>
      <li>Repeat cell counts for the  second aliquot of the same islet sample using the second slide chamber. </li>
      <li>Repeat the highlighted steps (bullets 2 &ndash; 5) for the remaining sample.</li>
      <li>Note: Cells need to be imaged within 15 minutes of Trypan Blue  addition due to the dye cytotoxicity.</li>
      <li>Report average values of viable cells for duplicates of purified  islets based on two cell counts per each replicate.</li>

Cell suspension was labeled with Trypan Blue and viability measured  using Countess II automated cell counter. The output image of the cell counter  on the left shows viable cells in <em>green</em> and dead cells in <em>red</em>.
